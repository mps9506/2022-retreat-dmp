# Intro

-   Be respectful

-   Disclaimer - I bring a data science perspective and bias

## Why do we plan for data management? {background-image="background.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

## Why do we plan for data management?

::: incremental
-   Sponsor Requirements

-   Publication Requirements

-   Project Continuity

-   Facilitate Collaboration

# What is data?

# How do we manage data?

-   Identify tools and formats that meet your needs

-   Plan additional time and effort to carry out management tasks

# How do we manage data?

::: incremental
-   Try to retain raw data in non-proprietary formats
-   üòÄ good formats :
    -   text files - `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.ascii`, `.html`, etc.
    -   containers - `.tar`, `.gzip`, `.zip`
    -   geospatial - `.shp`, `.tiff`, `.gpk`, `.cdf`, etc.
    -   images - `.tiff`, `.png`, `.bmp`, and other lossless formats.
    -   databases - `xml` and `csv` for simple databases, MySQL and PostgreSQL for relational dbs.
    -   lots of others available depending on project needs
-   Library of Congress maintains information about the sustainability of various digital formats: https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/

# How do we manage data?

::: incremental
-   ü§® meh formats:
    -   text files - various MS office files. Be aware that Excel is notorious for auto-formatting data resulting in data transformation or loss.
    -   geospatial - `.gdb` proprietary spatial database package for ESRI. Standard in the industry but inaccessible to QGIS, R, Python, etc.
-   üò¨ generally not suitable for long-term storage or sharing:
    -   Completely proprietary formats -`.rds`, `.rdata`, `.sas7bdat`

# Don't manipulate raw data

-   Once raw data is altered, you may or may not be able to restore it.

-   Read/copy data into to an analysis spreadsheet, script, etc.

# Metadata

-   Data about your data.

-   Can be manually created.

-   Several tools available to create metadata that meets ISO standards and federal guidelines.

# Sync/backup

-   Backup and syncing snapshots the current state of your data and stores it somewhere else.

-   Allows restoration of prior versions of your data.

# Sync/backup

```{r}
#| echo: false
data.frame("Method" = c("Local Backup", "OneDrive/Teams", "Distributed <br /> Version Control <br /> (Github, GitLab, etc."),
                    "Ease of Imp" = c("‚úÖ", "‚úÖ","‚ùå"),
                    "Reliability" = c("‚ùå", "üü°", "‚úÖ"),
                    "Collaboration" = c("‚ùå","‚úÖ","‚úÖ"),
                    "Notes" = c("- Automated backup require additional setup/software <br />- No file versioning",
                                "- Fully automated<br />- Limited file versioning",
                                "- Strong file versioning <br />- High difficulty to implement"
                                )) |>

# Sharing

**Sharing** means making the current state of your data available to others (internal or external to the Institute). Why is this needed?

-   Collaboration on a data analysis, writing, etc.

-   Publication or delivery of datasets

# Sharing

Sharing for collaboration:

-   Distributed version control is difficult but standard for code projects.
-   OneDrive/Google Sheets and other cloud services make sharing easy.

# Sharing

Sharing for publication:

-   Long-term archiving available through numerous data repository services.
-   Examples: [Texas Data Repository](https://dataverse.tdl.org/), [CUAHSI Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/), [figshare](https://figshare.com/)
-   [re3Data](https://www.re3data.org/) provides a comprehensive list and information on data repositories.
-   TAMU librarians are good resource to select appropriate repositories.
